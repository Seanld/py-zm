# Z- in Python

`py-zm` is a Z- language interpreter written in Python. As long as you have Python 3.x installed, you should be good to go. There are <u>no</u> third party libraries used in the interpreter. It's all native Python code, and native Python libraries/modules. While this does reinvent the wheel, it's smaller, and more portable than it would be had I used `ply` (which sucks, by the way).

## Getting Started wtih Z- and py-zm

If you want to learn how to write and run Z- programs, head over to this repository's Wiki. You'll find (hopefully) everything you need there!

## About

Time for extra facts!

### Why Z- Was Created

I thought it would be good on my portfolio for when I look for some jobs in a few years. Building your own language is pretty impressive, if you think about it (no matter how efficient it is).

I also figured that it would pretty fun to work on and build. A good time passer, indeed.

The last reason: it would definitely be something useful to put in my package manager for [StaSh](https://github.com/ywangd/stash): [Latte](https://github.com/Seanld/Latte). It desperately needs to be populated with some packages.

### Why Do I Think `ply` Sucks?

If you know what `ply` is, you know it's confusing as heck, and that the syntax for it is NOT Pythonic in any way whatsoever. I can't stand looking at it whenever I see people creating interpreters with it. It _actually_ makes me cringe. If you're gonna make an interpreter with `ply`, you might as well just write your own tokenizer and parser. It's not that difficult, and you actually know how to use it properly.

## Contributions

In advance, I thank all contributers for the work they will provide in building this language up. It needs more creative minds to be great!
